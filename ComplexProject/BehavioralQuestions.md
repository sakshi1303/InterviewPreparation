## Situation when you have gone ABOVE & BEYOND and provided extra information/metrics from your end.

> - Situation was we were given a requirement where business wanted to get details at aggregated level for an entity.
> - Task was to provide the required information from our end
> - Action taken was I got the all the required information and created a reporting query for the same. While analysing I found that breakdown view along with the aggregated view was very helpful and provided the detailed information which later helped in solving one of the cases when we were able to match the values from business and system along with identifying the root cause.
> - This was very helpful and later I got appreciated by the customers, PM's and other stakeholders.

## Situation when you went against the stakeholders and told them you were INCORRECT and taken charge and provided your solution.

> - Situation was where we had to create a Strategic Client Dashboard at top most level entity i.e. at Ultimate Parent Company Level.
> - Task was to analyse the data at one lower level and get the aggregated view for Company level.
> - Action taken were
    >> - In the initial discussion and analysis, we found that since we have the view at one level below what we wanted, we can get aggregate and get the required data which was also matching for few sample cases. 
     >> - Later as and when we started analying with more sets, we found that the Ultimate Parent level structure data cannot be met by just aggregation. 
     >> - To solve it, we created a mapping table to store the entities and their hierarchical relationships and created a view over over lower level.
     >> - With this we were able to solve the data issues and mismatches but the performance of query was not upto the mark.
     >> - I then created a materialised view instead of the view and the problem got solved.
> - Result was that we were not able to match the requirements but the turn around time was good.
